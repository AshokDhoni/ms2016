# Climbing Log

#### 11.26.16 — Red River Gorge, Muir Valley

##### Johnny's Wall
- 5.9 *2 Chicken Butts* (L) - fail
    + Couldn't work up the courage to make the reach for the crux at the second bolt
- 5.8 *Thanks Holly* (L)
    + Not technical, pretty fun, slabby start. Saw a girl fall before the first clip — yikes.

##### Techtonics Wall
- 5.10B *Gettin' Lucky in Kentucky*
    + Super fun, not super technical
- 5.8 *Tall Cool One* (L)
    + Pretty scary slab to ledge, scary roof, but easy the rest of the way. Fun route.

##### The Hideout
- 5.10A *Moots Madness* (S+L)
    + First route I've ever set. Scary crimpy start (stick clipped first draw), not super technical after that but I got pumped by the top, took a fall failing to clip the draws at the anchors. Short, kinda annoying.
- 5.10C *Pre-emptive Strike*
    + So much fun! Skipped the real 10C crimpy start and opted for the crack on the side. Rest was more like 10A Went up at dark, had a blast, it has everything, and it's a long route! Got to clean in the dark too — so cool!

#### 11.27.16 — Red River Gorge, PMRP

##### The Shire
- 5.8 *Audie* (L)
    + Short and sweet, pretty fun!
- 5.9+ *Miranda Rayne*
    + Definitely on the 10A side, not super technical for most of it, just overhung and pumpy, and the end hits you with some two/three-finger pulls that felt more technical. Really fun route though!

#### 11.29.16 — BKB
- 5.9 (L) - on-sight
- 5.9+ (L) - scend
- 5.10B - on-sight
  + The purple babyhead route in the corner, so much fun!

  + Red one near the babyhead route — overhung, some pretty challenging reaches, had to take once 3/4 of the way to the top
- 5.10A/B - on-sight
- 5.10C - fail
  + Super fun mantel start, got stuck in the roof corner

#### 11.30.16 - BKB

  + Green corner route, pretty fun, pretty pumpy

  + The purple babyhead again — this time on lead, felt good!
- 5.10C
  + Second attempt at the corner blue 10.C — struggled through the same move, but got through it. I needed to get my right hand up before my left, then right foot up. Very fun — need to revisit.
