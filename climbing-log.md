# Climbing Log

#### 11.26.16 — Red River Gorge, Muir Valley

##### Johnny's Wall
- 5.9 *2 Chicken Butts* (L) - fail
    + Couldn't work up the courage to make the reach for the crux at the second bolt
- 5.8 *Thanks Holly* (L)
    + Not technical, pretty fun, slabby start. Saw a girl fall before the first clip — yikes.

##### Techtonics Wall
- 5.10B *Gettin' Lucky in Kentucky*
    + Super fun, not super technical
- 5.8 *Tall Cool One* (L)
    + Pretty scary slab to ledge, scary roof, but easy the rest of the way. Fun route.

##### The Hideout
- 5.10A *Moots Madness* (S+L)
    + First route I've ever set. Scary crimpy start (stick clipped first draw), not super technical after that but I got pumped by the top, took a fall failing to clip the draws at the anchors. Short, kinda annoying.
- 5.10C *Pre-emptive Strike*
    + So much fun! Skipped the real 10C crimpy start and opted for the crack on the side. Rest was more like 10A Went up at dark, had a blast, it has everything, and it's a long route! Got to clean in the dark too — so cool!

#### 11.27.16 — Red River Gorge, PMRP

##### The Shire
- 5.8 *Audie* (L)
    + Short and sweet, pretty fun!
- 5.9+ *Miranda Rayne*
    + Definitely on the 10A side, not super technical for most of it, just overhung and pumpy, and the end hits you with some two/three-finger pulls that felt more technical. Really fun route though!

#### 11.29.16 — BKB

- 5.9+ (L)
- 5.10B - on-sight

  + The purple babyhead again — this time on lead, felt good!
- 5.10C
  + Second attempt at the corner blue 10.C — struggled through the same move, but got through it. I needed to get my right hand up before my left, then right foot up. Very fun — need to revisit.

- 5.10B
  + Yellow one in the corner, sliped on the very last move!!! Pretty fun though.
- 5.11A
  + Blue one with the gnarly big donut on the overhang. This was really fun. Took three times — once I slipped and I know I can get through that, then at the overhang, which after doing it, I think I can get through it too, and then once at the top, which was from just being pumped.

- 5.11A (auto)
  + The black auto route, I tried a bunch, kept falling at the small finger pocket, but I got the route down up to that point solid, and I feel good about it. Still got stuck on the overhang though.
- 5.11B - fail
  + Yellow route, really challenging with a pretty dynamic move that took me about 10 attempts to stick, and I gave up 3/4 of the way up cause it was closing time and I had little energy left in me. Will try again.

- 5.10A (L)
